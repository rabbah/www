          <span style="color:#3f3f3fe8 !important;font-weight:bold">I am Dr. Rodric Rabbah and I am running for a 3-year term on the Somers Board of Education.</span>
          I have two children in the district, Michel in the fourth grade and Timothy in the first grade. My wife Cynthia is a radiation physicist in cancer treatment.
          We moved to Somers 8 years ago and we love living here.<br/>
          <br/>
          My educational background includes a Doctorate in Computer Science from Georgia Tech, and several more years in academia at MIT.
          There, I enjoyed teaching new computer science classes to undergraduate and graduate students.<br/>
          <br/>
          I then spent eleven years at IBM Research in Yorktown. And now I am the co-founder of a cloud computing company with notable recognition from industry analysts.<br/>

            <li> Fiscal responsibility and strategic investment in our educators and facilities.</li>
          </ol>
          We need new perspectives and relevant experience on the Board, and I will be an effective advocate for you and your children.<br/>
